Creating an Web Server using Socket Programming: Develop a simple web server in C/JAVA that is capable of processing requests in the following ways:
 1. Create a connection socket when contacted by a client (Browser)
 2. Receive the HTTP request from this connection
 3. Parse the request to determine the specific file being requested
 4. Get the requested file from the server's file system
 5. Create an HTTP response message consisting of the requested file preceded by header lines
 6. Send a response over the TCP connection to the requesting browser
